# Hawkaii HRMS Production Task Sheet

Last updated: 2026-05-23

## Executive Summary

This versioned report captures the completed Phase 4 Projects/utilization slice after Dashboard, Employee CRUD/Admin, Attendance, Leave/WFH/Holidays, and EMS. The root task sheet remains at `docs/implementation/HRMS_PRODUCTION_TASK_SHEET.md`, but the repository root is not a Git repo, so this backend copy records implementation state inside a versioned repo.

## Current Verified Status

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Backend OpenAPI | 136 implemented operations across 121 paths |
| Planned operations remaining | 79 |
| Dashboard backend/frontend | Completed for backend summary API and frontend summary integration |
| Employee admin backend/frontend | Completed for employee create/update, lifecycle, login, roles, and org selectors |
| Attendance backend/frontend | Completed for punches, my/team summary, monthly calendar, exceptions, and regularization request/decision |
| Leave/WFH/Holidays backend/frontend | Completed for balances, leave requests, WFH requests, manager decisions, HR monitor, holidays, and visible frontend routes |
| EMS backend | Implemented for profile, profile change requests, HR profile decisions, generic service requests, HR service queue, letters, and policy acknowledgements |
| EMS frontend | Integrated in `hrms-client` for dashboard profile signals, profile, requests, letters, policies, and HR admin profile/letter queues |
| Projects/utilization backend | Implemented for project CRUD, members, allocations, milestones/modules, project documents, project summary, and team utilization |
| Projects/utilization frontend | Integrated in `hrms-client` for `/projects`, `/projects/$id`, and `/team-utilization` in API mode |
| Root task sheet | Updated but uncommitted by design because root has no `.git` |

## Projects / Utilization API Inventory

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/projects` | `/projects` add project drawer | Create project metadata with assigned manager |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects` | `/projects`, project store consumers | List visible projects with members, allocations, milestones, documents, and summary in API mode |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}` | `/projects/$id` | Project detail with include support |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}` | `/projects`, `/projects/$id` | Versioned project metadata/status update |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/archive` | Domain adapter available | Archive project after active members are cleared or project is closed/paused |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/members` | Domain adapter available | List project members |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/members` | Project drawer team step | Add member and create initial allocation |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/members/{member_id}` | Project drawer/team removal | Versioned member update/remove |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/allocations` | Domain adapter available | Allocation history/list |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/allocations` | Domain adapter available | Add allocation history row and update member allocation |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/milestones` | Domain adapter available | List milestones/modules |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/milestones` | Domain adapter available | Add milestone/module |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/documents` | `/projects/$id` documents tab | Lists existing document records attached to business object type `project` |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/projects/{id}/summary` | `/projects/$id` | Project timesheet, expense, and allocation summary |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/team-utilization/summary` | `/team-utilization` | Capacity, allocation, submitted hours, bench, and overload analytics |

Deferred from the original Projects/utilization plan: richer project reports, project-specific timesheet submission detail, and upload/attach document UX remain planned for later report/document hardening phases.

## Remaining Blockers

| Priority | Blocker |
| --- | --- |
| P1 | No frontend e2e/user-flow baseline for EMS, Leave/WFH/Holidays, or Attendance |
| P1 | EMS-specific document wrapper APIs remain planned; visible EMS document screens continue using the existing Documents APIs |
| P1 | EMS onboarding, probation, exits, policy management, and letter generation admin actions remain static until broader HR/admin modules exist |
| P1 | Helpdesk remains mock/local only and is the next Phase 4 feature |
| P1 | Project-specific reports, timesheet submission detail, and project document upload/attach UX remain planned |
| P1 | Attendance daily detail, manager queue alias, export/report endpoints, and richer attendance reports remain planned |
| P1 | Leave/WFH export/report endpoint remains planned for reports/admin phase |
| P2 | Frontend lint keeps 39 existing Fast Refresh warnings |
| P2 | Frontend build keeps chunk-size/Wrangler log warnings but exits successfully |

## Validation Results

Backend:

- `pnpm typecheck`: passed
- `pnpm build`: passed
- `pnpm lint`: passed with escalation due `tsx` IPC sandboxing
- `pnpm api:docs:generate`: passed; generated 136 operation frontend contract
- `pnpm api:docs:verify`: passed
- `pnpm db:verify:no-cross-schema-fks`: passed
- `pnpm exec vitest run --project integration src/modules/projects/__tests__/projects.integration.test.ts`: passed, 1 test
- `pnpm test:contracts`: passed, 13 tests
- `pnpm test:infra:down`: passed

Frontend:

- `pnpm format`: passed
- `pnpm exec tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit`: passed
- `pnpm lint`: passed with 39 existing warnings
- `pnpm api:implemented-route-guard`: passed, 51 files against 121 paths
- `pnpm api:frontend-contract:route-coverage`: passed, 85 routes across 15 groups
- `pnpm build`: passed with existing chunk-size/Wrangler log warnings

## Assumptions

- EMS profile change requests intentionally model one field per request because the current UI submits one selected field at a time.
- EMS decisions use status values (`approved`, `returned`, `rejected`) rather than leave/WFH action verbs.
- EMS generic service requests support create/list/HR queue only in this slice; assignment and closure workflows stay planned for later HR operations.
- EMS-specific employee document wrapper endpoints are deferred because the current EMS document UI already uses the backend Documents APIs for list/download/verify.
- EMS admin onboarding, probation, exits, policy management, and letter generation tabs remain non-production placeholders until their backend modules are defined.
- Projects list responses intentionally include members, allocations, milestones/modules, documents, and summary by default so the existing project store can hydrate visible screens without adding a generated client layer.
- Project document APIs list documents already attached to `business_object_type = "project"`; upload/attach UX remains part of later document hardening.

## Next Steps

1. Phase 4 Projects/utilization is complete for the first production-ready vertical slice.
2. Backend OpenAPI now has 136 operations across 121 paths; planned operations remaining are 79.
3. Visible project portfolio/detail and team utilization screens use backend APIs in API mode; explicit non-production fallback remains available only through the existing config path.
4. Next Phase 4 scope: Helpdesk backend APIs and frontend integration.
